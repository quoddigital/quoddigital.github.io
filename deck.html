		# Exclusive Personal Injury Client Acquisition Agency
*“We deliver high-intent personal injury clients directly to law firms — warm, qualified, and ready to consult.”*

---

## The Problem
- Personal injury law firms struggle with:
  - Overflow of unqualified leads
  - Missed calls & slow follow-up → lost revenue
  - High acquisition cost for high-value clients
- Market pain: PI clients are highly search-driven but intake conversion is poor

---

## The Opportunity
- PI law is a **multi-billion-dollar market** in the U.S.
- High-value clients: average signed case $10k–$50k+
- Firms willing to pay **$5k–$20k/mo** for exclusive, high-converting leads
- Search + intent = repeatable acquisition pipeline

---

## Our Solution
- **We handle client acquisition end-to-end**
  - Google Ads, Local SEO, Retargeting
- **We own first-touch UX**
  - Landing pages, live chat, phone call intake
- **We qualify and warm-transfer leads**
  - Live call transfers or scheduled consults
- **Outcome:** Law firms spend less, get more signed cases

---

## How It Works
Click → Landing Page → Call/Chat → Intake Qualification → Warm Transfer → Attorney Consultation → Signed Case  
*We track every lead to signed case.*

---

## Market Strategy
- **Exclusivity model:** one firm per city & practice area  
- **Target cities:** start with 10–20 metro areas  
- **Scale:** expand city-by-city as proof-of-concept solidifies  
- **Retention moat:** intake quality + attribution + SEO authority

---

## Revenue Model
| Model | Rate / Fee |
|-------|------------|
| Flat monthly retainer | $7k–$20k per city |
| Per qualified lead | $500–$2,500 |
| Hybrid (retainer + per signed case) | $5k–$10k + $500/case |

- High-margin recurring revenue  
- Upsell potential: multi-city expansion, additional practice areas

---

## Why Us / Moat
- **Traffic + UX expertise:** clicks convert into signed clients  
- **Exclusive territories:** no competing firms → higher retention  
- **Intake ownership:** fast, scripted, high-trust warm handoff  
- **Tracking & attribution:** every lead tied to signed case  
- **SEO + content:** defensible moat, reduces CPC over time

---

## Competitive Landscape
- Competitors:
  - Generic legal lead vendors (low conversion)
  - Traditional marketing agencies (traffic only, no intake)
- **Our advantage:** full pipeline ownership + exclusivity + performance guarantee

---

## Go-To-Market / Growth Plan
1. Launch in 5–10 high-value cities
2. Perfect intake + warm-transfer flow  
3. Expand city-by-city, enforcing exclusivity  
4. Add additional practice areas (immigration, workers comp)  
5. SEO authority → reduced ad spend, higher margins

---

## Unit Economics (Example)
- City monthly revenue: $10,000  
- Ad spend: $3,000  
- Operations & intake: $2,500  
- Net profit: $4,500/month per city → scalable across 50+ cities  
*Revenue grows linearly as new cities added*

---

## Team
- Media experts: Ads + SEO
- Intake & call operations: trained staff
- Sales / business development: onboarding law firms
- Advisors: legal compliance + marketing

---

## Legal & Compliance

- Referral & fee-sharing compliant in each state  
- Disclaimers and call recordings standard

---

## Ask / Funding / Next Steps

  - Build intake infrastructure
  - Launch ads and SEO campaigns
